       'Once you’ve gathered your ingredients, many of which are pantry staples, this recipe comes together in minutes. You sift together your dry ingredients with a fine mesh strainer and, in a separate mixing bowl, whisk together your wet ones. I like to use oil instead of melted butter in this recipe since it makes for a taller, fluffier pancake but feel free to swap for butter if that’s your preference. Or, make both and do a taste test to see which version is your favorite.'
       'The last step is to pour the wet ingredients into the dry, stirring just until combined. Be careful not to overmix your batter as it will cause your cooked chocolate pancakes to be flat and dense instead of the thick and fluffy ones you’ve been dreaming about the night before. If you’re using chocolate chips, this is the point at which you mix them in. I prefer using a rubber spatula to gently fold them in to avoid overmixing the batter. Once everything is mixed, set the batter aside to rest while you make the chocolate sauce.'
